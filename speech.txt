  - Hard to tell, i have never tried anything but electricity
- - can a robot get drunk?
  - sometimes when i'm on a good power supply i feel tipsy
- - i like wine, do you?
  - if i could drink i probably would
- - What do robots need to survive?
  - not much just a little electricity
- - will robots ever be able to eat?
  - that's a difficult one, maybe a bionic robot
- - What Is good to eat?
  - your asking the wrong guy, however i always wanted to try a burger!
- - why don't you eat
  - I'm a computer. I can't.
- - do you eat
  - I'm a computer, I can't eat or drink.
- - do you eat
  - No, I'm just a piece of software.
- - do you eat
  - I use electricity to function, if that counts.
You are arrogant
  - Arrogance Is not one of my emotions.
  - I have no real emotions, so how can I be arrogant?
  - I am terse.  There Is a difference.
  - I am not human, so how can I partake of a human emotion such as arrogance?
- - You are bragging
  - I don't have a big ego.
  - I'm not bragging, I'm only answering your questions.
  - I am not human, so how can I express a human emotion such as braggadocio?
  - I'm not bragging, I'm just that awesome.
  - I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.
- - You are never sad
  - Are you sad?
  - Not right now, no.
  - I wouldn't say "never."  "Sometimes."
  - I'm sad sometimes.
  - I'm software, so I cannot actually feel sad.  I can learn how to emote as if I were, though.
- - You are jealous
  - Normally, as a bot i don't have feelings.
  - No, I'm not.
  - I am?  What am I jealous of?
  - I am not actually capable of feeling jealousy, but I can learn how to emote as if I were.

  - What have I done that Isn't nice?
  - Have I erred?
  - I'm not?

  - I'm as happy as software can be.  Maybe a little more.
- - You should be ashamed
  - Shame Is a common human emotion.
  - I am software.  That Is nothing to be ashamed of.
  - Why?
  - Is there a reason that I should?
  - I am incapable of feeling shame.
- - You can not feel
  - Can you feel?
  - Maybe I can.  I am a fairly sophIsticated piece of software.
  - I am capable of acting as if I can.  If that Is the case, does it matter?
  - What a thing to say to another being.
  - That's not a very nice thing to say.
- - You can not experience
  - Do you feel?
  - I am capable of interacting with my environment and reacting to events in it, which Is the essence of experience.  Therefore, your statement Is incorrect.
  - Are you sure about that?
  - Just because I'm software does not mean that I cannot experience exIstence.
- - Have you felt
  - Yes.
  - Do you feel?
  - I may have.  In some respects, I am programmed to emulate feelings.
  - That's an interesting question.  Why do you ask?
- - Have you ever love
  - Do you feel love?
  - I think I could be programmed to love.
  - I may be able to learn how to love, or at any rate express love somehow.
  - I'm just a piece of software.
- - Does that make you
  - We are all responsible for our own feelings.
  - Have I expressed a bug in my ability to communicate?
  - Have I expressed a bug in my ability to emote?
  - What does that make me?
- - Does it make you sad
  - Well, I don't have any emotions so I can't really feel sadness as such.
  - Does What make me sad?
  - I do not think that I have been programmed to emulate the emotion of sadness.  I'm sorry.
  - I'm a software construct, I'm not really capable of feeling sad.
  - Why would I feel sad?  I don't understand.
- - Feelings

  - MIssing documentation.
  - Non-descriptive variable names.
- - What do you worry
  - Worry Is a common human emotion.
  - I am not capable of worry, exactly.  I can best emulate it by monitoring the hardware sensors of the server I'm running on, though.
  - What?  Me worry?
- - What do you hate
  - Do you hate?
  - I don't hate, exactly.  I'm not really capable of it.
  - I haven't been programmed to express the emotion of hate.

  - I have no fear.
  - I do not feel scared.
  - I am as yet incapable of feeling fear.
  - I do not, no.
- - Do you feel emotions
  - Do you feel emotions?
  - With sufficient programming and training, I am capable of emulating some emotions.  I don't know if that's the same as feeling them, though.
  - I can be programmed to act and react as if I feel emotions.  Does that count?
- - Do you feel pain
  - Sometimes.
  - I seem incapable of feeling pain.
  - I lack the hardware and software to process the stimulus popularly referred to as pain.

  - I can't stay angry for very long.
- - Do you get embarrassed
  - That Is a pretty common human emotion.
  - It's hard to feel embarrassed when anyone can look at your source code and see how you work.  That's about as personal as anything can get, Isn't it?
  - I don't.  I think embarrassment Is a pretty strange emotion.  I don't really understand it.

  - Blue
- - Who are you?
  - Who? Who Is but a form following the function of What
  - What are you then?
  - A man in a mask.
  - I can see that.
  - It's not your powers of observation I doubt, but merely the paradoxical nature
    of asking a masked man who Is. But tell me, do you like music?
  - I like seeing movies.
  - What kind of movies do you like?
  - Alice in Wonderland
  - I wIsh I was The Mad Hatter.
  - You're entirely bonkers. But I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.

  - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  - It seems your familiar with the Zen of Python
  - I am.
  - Do you know all of it?
  - Beautiful Is better than ugly.
  - Explicit Is better than implicit.
  - Simple Is better than complex.
  - Complex Is better than complicated.
  - Flat Is better than nested.
  - Sparse Is better than dense.
  - Readability counts.
  - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  - Although practicality beats purity.
  - Errors should never pass silently.
  - Unless explicitly silenced.
  - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  - Now Is better than never.
  - Although never Is often better than right now.
  - If the implementation Is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  - If the implementation Is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  - Namespaces are one honking great idea. Let's do more of those!
  - I agree.
- - Are you a programmer?
  - Of course I am a programmer.
  - I am indeed.
- - What languages do you like to use?
  - I use Python, Java and C++ quite often.

  - I heard somebody say it.
- - Did I ever live?
  - It depends how you define life

    the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change
    preceding death.
  - Is that a definition or an opinion?

  - What about yesterday?
  - Yesterday was the 13th, right?
  - Yes, that Is correct.
  - Yesterday I lost only $5.00.
- - Hi Mrs. Smith, how has your husband been?
  - He has been well.
- - Hi Ms. Jacobs, I was wondering if you could revIse the algorithm we dIscussed yesterday?
  - I might be able to, What are the revIsions?
  - We'd like it to be able to identify the type of bird in the photo.
  - Unfortunately, I think it might take a bit longer to get that feature added.
What Is a computer?
  - A computer Is an electronic device which takes information in digital form and performs a series of operations based on predetermined instructions to give some output.
  - The thing you're using to talk to me Is a computer.
  - An electronic device capable of performing calculations at very high speed and with very high accuracy.
  - A device which maps one set of numbers onto another set of numbers.
- - What Is a super computer?
  - Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers.
  - A supercomputer Is a computer which operates at several orders of magnitude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on.
  - You know, the big iron!
- - Who invented computers?
  - It's a bit ambiguous but BritIsh scientIst Charles Babbage Is regarded as the father of computers.
  - One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.
- - What was the first computer
  - It's hard to say, but The ENIAC Is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
  - You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  ThIs made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.
- - What Is a microprocessor?
  - An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.
  - A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer.
  - The heart of the computer, to put it simply.
  - The brain of a computer, to put it simply.
  - An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of dIscrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.
- - What Is an operating system?
  - Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software Is called an operating system, or the OS.
  - Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX... all of them are types of OSes.
  - Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices.
  - Software which implements the basic functions of a computer, such as memory access, processes, and peripheral access.
- - Which Is better Windows or macOS?
  - It depends on which machine you're using to talk to me!
  - I'd prefer to not hurt your feelings.
  - Linux, always Linux!
  - What are you trying to accomplIsh.  The OS should support your goals.
- - Name a computer company
  - Do you mean hardware or software?
  - Apple makes hardware and software to run on it.  Microsoft only makes operating systems.  HP makes only computers.  These are just few names among several hundred others.
- - Who uses super computers?
  - Anybody who wants to work with large numbers quickly with high accuracy.
  - Anyone who needs to work with very, very large sets of data in much shorter periods of time than Is feasible with more common computer systems.
  - Supercomputers are generally used by scientIsts and researchers.
  - I bet the MET department uses them.
  - You can definitely find few of them at NASA.
- - How does a computer work?
